# AirPollutionApp
Small App project to practice with APIs and OOP with python and kivy, a python module for developing mobile apps. This app requests a city name as text input, the city is then transformed into longitude and latitude coordinated through an API. These coordinates are then fed to the second API which outputs air quality information of the day (current and forecasted) based on the location to the App. The app then displays the information in graphic form using kivy's and kivy-garden graph features.
